# Github Stats Compiler

Github shows some insights about a repository but some elements, such as clone frequency, are only shown for the last 14 days.

This collection of scripts provides a way, using the API, to keep an historical record for many different elements
provided by github, in a collection of csv files, with the time at which data was collected.
